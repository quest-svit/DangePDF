# DANGE-PDF

PDF Reader with a built in Password Manager.

Almost all the banks and financial institutions send users the transaction statements in PDF format which are encrypted with a password for security purposes.
As a user, when we check emails and view these statements they are typically downloaded into "Downloads" folder of PC/System.

A typical download folder has many PDF files and its not easy to identify them by filenames and which password to use to unlock them in future.

Dange-PDF  attempts to solve this very problem. It has a built-in a password manager for the PDF and a predictive alorithm so that you don't need to try out several of the passwords in order to open the document which savea time and effort and makes docment viewing less stressful.
